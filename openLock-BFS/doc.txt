Steps for the BFS Solution:

### Initialize the BFS Queue:
Start from the initial state "0000".
Use a queue to keep track of states to be processed, starting with "0000".

### Handle Deadends:
Use a set to store deadend states for quick lookup.
If the initial state "0000" is a deadend, return -1 immediately.

### Visited States:
Use a set to keep track of visited states to avoid processing the same state multiple times.

### Process the Queue:
For each state, generate its neighboring states by turning each wheel one slot up or down.
If a neighboring state is the target, return the current number of steps + 1.
If a neighboring state is not a deadend and has not been visited, mark it as visited and add it to the queue.

### Termination:
If the queue is exhausted and the target state is not reached, return -1.
